Over the last month or so I started using the PC-Bite kit for probing
electrical PCBs on my lab bench at my office. Here's a photo of the
device with only a single probe in use.

The probes are highly flexible and heavy enough that they stay in
place once you get them positioned where you want them. The probes
themselves have small springs that keep pressure on the needle-point
for good contact with the PCB trace or device pin you're probing. The
probes use flying leads for easy connection to your scope or logic
analyzer.

Search for "PC-Bite" on Amazon to review.
