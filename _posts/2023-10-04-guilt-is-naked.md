## Guilt is Naked

You've probably heard the story of the Emperor's New Clothes. I won't
recount it here, but the bottom line is that guilt is naked; it's
based on mistaken beliefs. If you experience long-term guilt, seeing
these mistakes may help you.

### Message From a Colleague

I cringed when this message appeared in the group chat the other day:

*I don’t have the heart to tell [Executive] that we haven’t used [Expensive Tool] since we licensed it a year ago and now we need to renew the license!*

My colleague was clearly feeling a little bit guilty and responsible
for this situation. No doubt you've seen similar situations in your
work.

### My Guilt Trips

I have wrestled with feelings of guilt at times in my life. And I have
made some major mistakes that left me feeling guilty for years. I'm
happy to talk about them, and yet I also don't assume you're here for
my life story. Contact me if you're interested in the details.

In wrestling with my guilt, I've thought a lot about whether it's
reasonable to feel guilty for long periods of time. Of course the
emotion is going to come up for all of us at times, but long term
feelings of guilt have no logical basis.

Let me give you a couple of points to consider.

### The Future is Unpredictable

We often believe the future is predictable. It's not. We can and do
make guesses about how we think the future will unfold, but understand
that they are always *guesses*.

The farther into the future we try to predict, the greater the likelihood
that our predictions will miss the mark.

The late Alan Watts used to tell a story about a
[Chinese farmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWd6fNVZ20o).
In two minutes, it will change your perpsective dramatically on the
idea that anyone can predict the future.

### The Fallacy of Single Causes

Another reason we often shoulder unearned guilt is the belief that
events have single, identifiable causes. This is rarely, if ever, the
case.

Consider the cautionary tale "For Want of a Nail":

```
  For want of a nail the shoe was lost,
  For want of a shoe the horse was lost,
  For want of a horse the rider was lost,
  For want of a rider the battle was lost,
  For want of a battle the kingdom was lost,
  And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.
```

This tale eloquently illustrates that outcomes are usually the result
of a chain of events, many of which are beyond our control. If you
find yourself feeling guilty about the "loss of a kingdom," perhaps
it's time to have a word with the king's farrier. He's the one who
failed to ensure all the horseshoes were properly fitted before the
battle commenced.

Of course, the farrier could argue that he, too, was a victim of a
series of preceding events beyond his control. And he'd be correct.

### Conclusion

It's not possible to stop feelings of guilt from coming up from time
to time. It is possible to train yourself to recognize these feelings
do come up and to then redirect your thinking when it happens.

Knowing that guilt ultimately has no foundation can help you to avoid
dwelling on past mistakes.

#### Researchers

[Robert Sapolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sapolsky)
is a renowned neuroscientist and primatologist, best known for his
work on stress physiology in primates and its implications for human
behavior. He is a professor at Stanford University and has received
numerous awards for his research and teaching. One of his most
provocative contributions is his exploration of the concept of free
will. Sapolsky argues that human behavior is far more deterministic
than commonly believed, shaped by a complex interplay of genetics,
environment, and biochemical processes. He contends that our
understanding of "free will" may be more of an illusion, challenging
traditional notions of individual responsibility and moral agency.
