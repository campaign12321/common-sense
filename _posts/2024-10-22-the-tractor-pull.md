<!-- [Audio Discussion](https://common-sense.com/assets/files/tractor-pull.mp3) -->

Sarah stops by Marco's office to talk about a recent topic they
discussed in a team meeting. Sarah wants to know more about what
Marco has planned for the team.

Marco is happy to oblige and discusses one of the purposes of their
team meetings. They have a good discussion in which Marco uses the
metaphor of a county fair tractor pull.

The metaphor makes sense to Sarah and she leaves the meeting with
Marco with a task that interests her and better prepared to help her
team.

The Tractor Pull

Sarah knocked on Marco's office door, finding him at his standing desk
reviewing some code. He looked up with a warm smile. "Hey Sarah, come
on in."

"Thanks, Marco. I appreciated yesterday's discussion about assertion
checking," Sarah said, settling into one of the chairs across from his
desk. "I think the discussions you encourage are helpful."

Marco nodded, lowering his desk and taking a seat. "I'm glad you found
it useful. What particularly resonated with you?"

"Well, the whole strategy makes a lot of sense technically," Sarah
replied. "But I'm curious about the bigger picture. Why is this kind
of structured approach so important for our development process
itself?"

Marco's eyes lit up at the question. "That's exactly the kind of
thinking I like to see, Sarah. You're looking beyond the technical
details to understand the broader impact." He paused for a moment,
gathering his thoughts. "What I'm really trying to do is improve the
flow - the rate - at which our team delivers quality work.

"Flow of quality work?" Sarah leaned forward, interested.

"Yes. I'm working to understand the sources of variation in our daily
work," Marco explained. "The goal is to make our work more predictable
and consistently high-quality. It's about improving both our
throughput and the quality of what we deliver."

Sarah nodded slowly. "And controlling variation helps with that?"

"Absolutely. You can't manage a process that's out of control – a
process that's unpredictable," Marco said. "That's why we focus so
much on best practices like our assertion strategy, and other
strategies we will discuss in the coming months. There are many things
we will be doing. All of them will be aimed at reducing unnecessary
variation in how we work."

Marco paused, as if contemplating something, and then asked "Sarah,
have you ever been to a tractor pull?"

Sarah's face brightened with recognition. "Oh yes! When I was younger,
I used to go to them from time to time. The noise, the excitement –
watching those machines strain against increasingly heavy loads. It
was quite a spectacle."

Marco grinned. "Perfect! Then you know exactly what happens. The
tractor starts out strong and moving easily down the track. Yet as it
moves forward, the weight it's pulling moves forward on the sled,
making the sled harder and harder to pull. Most of the time, the load
on the tractor just becomes too much. It stalls before it reaches the
finish line. The engine on the tractor is roaring, there is a lot of
smoke and noise, but the tractor is just spinning its wheels. It's
working as hard as it can, but it's not making noticeable progress
anymore."

"Yep, just spinning its wheels," Sarah added, nodding.

"Exactly. And here's the connection to our work – I want to make sure
that on the Denali project, we don't fall into that same pattern. We
don't want our work to become progressively harder as we go along,
until we're working as hard as we can and yet just spinning our
wheels."

"Let me sketch something on the whiteboard. I want your comments on
this."

Marco drew a simple graph on the whiteboard. It looked like this:

Sarah's eyes widened with understanding. "So these best practices you
are introducing..."

"Are intended to help us keep the workload roughly constant," Marco
finished. "By catching issues early, maintaining clear standards, and
preventing technical debt from accumulating, we avoid that increasing
drag on our progress."

"That makes so much sense," Sarah said thoughtfully. "But how do we
measure whether we're succeeding at keeping the workload flat?"

"Good question," Marco replied. "We can look at things like the rate
of new issues being discovered, the time it takes to implement new
features, and the stability of our testing cycles. If these metrics
start trending up over time, it might indicate we're starting to pull
too heavy a load."

Sarah nodded enthusiastically. "And I suppose our assertion failures
during testing could be another indicator – if we start seeing more of
them, especially in areas we thought were stable, that might suggest
we're accumulating complexity."

"Exactly right," Marco said, clearly pleased with her
insights. "Sarah, would you be interested in leading a discussion
about this with the team? I think you could help everyone understand
how our technical practices connect to these broader goals."

Sarah sat up straighter, surprised but clearly interested. "Really?
Yes, I'd love to help with that. It would be a great opportunity to
explore these ideas further."

"Excellent," Marco said. "Take some time to think about how you want
to present it. Maybe we could start with the tractor pull analogy and
then dive into specific examples from our work."

"I'll start putting some thoughts together," Sarah said, standing
up. "Thanks, Marco. This has given me a whole new perspective on why
we do things the way we do."

As Sarah left his office, Marco noticed a feeling of competence in his
role as a manager. He knew Sarah would do a great job in sharing this
perspective with the team. And over time, their practice of software
engineering would improve.
