The following are the components of our primary offer to potential
customers.

# Potential Customers

Our potential customers are qualified individuals who want to greatly
improve the performance of embedded software development projects for
medical device development projects.

A qualified individual is someone who, in our judgment, has
significant influence over the course of a suitable project.

A suitable project is ...

1. One that is developing complex embedded software in C or C++,

2. Is for use on a non-trivial medical device (Class B or Class C),

3. Is one that is likely to take several engineers a year or more to
   complete,

4. Will not be using or inheriting a development environment or
   fixed development processes from a parent or other organization,

5. Is being managed by people with a compelling interest in the success
   of the project.
