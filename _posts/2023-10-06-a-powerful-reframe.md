## My Most Powerful Reframe

I'm heading off to the TOCICO 2023 Innovation Summit in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida tomorrow. I have attended Theory of Constraints
conferences for 30 years. For me, it's a great way to spend time with
the people of my tribe. The conferences are different since we lost
Eli Goldratt in 2011, yet they are still deeply satisfying to me.

At the conference this year, I hope to have some discussions with my
colleagues about a reframe that I have been using for several years
now. It's the most useful reframe I have ever experienced and it's
improved my life dramatically.

### What's a Reframe?

Let's start with an understanding of what is meant by a reframe.

A "reframe" is a cognitive and communicative technique used to change
the way a situation, experience, or concept is viewed or
interpreted. The goal is often to shift perspective from a negative or
unhelpful viewpoint to one that is more positive or
constructive. Reframing can be applied in various contexts, such as
problem-solving, emotional regulation, and interpersonal
communication.

For example, if someone views a failed project as a "waste of time," a
reframe might be to see it as a "learning experience" that provides
valuable insights for future endeavors. By changing the way the
situation is perceived, the emotional impact and subsequent actions
can also change, often for the better.

Reframing is commonly used in psychology, particularly in cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT), as well as in coaching, negotiation, and
conflict resolution. It's a versatile tool that can help individuals
and groups overcome challenges, resolve disagreements, and foster a
more positive outlook.

### My Old Frame

In the example I'm discussion, my old frame went like this:

"I can be harmed by the things that happen to me. People can hurt
me if I'm not careful, so I need to be on guard for those situations.

I also have to manage my image, both personal and professional. I
have to act a certain way, dress appropriately, drive the right kind
of car (actually, I drive a pickup truck, but you get the point), and
say the right kinds of things.

I also felt very attached to people and things, because hey, if I
don't get what I want from life, I could wind up feeling like a
failure later on. So, I constantly worried about my security, tried
to avoid conflict, and tried to grasp at the things that I thought
would make me happy.

I expect you can see how the idea that I could be harmed by things
that might happen to me set me up for all kinds of fear, worry and
defensive behaviors. The fear also made it more difficult for me to
let other people get close to me and for me to get close to them.

Bottom line, fear is one of those emotions that has about a million
different ways of showing up in your life and causing damage.

### My New Frame

My new frame, which I didn't come to immediately, is "I cannot be
harmed by anything that happens to me."

If you're a Theory of Constraints geek like I am, you might notice how
the new frame is essentially a perfect inversion of my old frame. How
often, when we use the TOC Thinking Processes, do we take an
assumption we want to challenge and completely invert it, as I did
here? I do it all the time. Have a negative that's bugging you? Invert
it and then figure out how to make it your reality. Trim the wings of
that flying pig!

In reality, a reframe doesn't absolutely have to be true to be
useful. So if find the reframe hard to accept, you can still try it on
for size.

People sometimes make fun of "Daily Affirmations," as if they are some
kind of feel-good psychobabble. I have found something different: When
I use them diligently, they work, and I can feel the difference.

Now I do in fact believe I cannot be harmed by anything that happens
to me. I cannot explain that here. I have invested years of thought
in forming my conclusions, and no one can necessarily reproduce my
exact steps. You can of course take your own, and if this kind of
stuff interests you, please do. Just know that you don't have to be
able to prove the reframe literally true to benefit from it.

So, consider standing in front of your bathroom mirror once a day
for five days. Repeat the reframe slowly and meaningfully ten times
or so. Give yourself a few minutes to do this. It might feel odd at
first, but just do it. No one is going to know!

### Resources

I do want to give you a few options that you can check out if you want
to know more. If you grab onto any of these threads and start chasing
them down, you'll be led to more material than you can read in a
lifetime.

One option is a get a copy of a recently published new book, "Beyond
Illusion" by Katrijn Van Oudheusden. You can find it on Amazon. The
book is about seeing through what is called the self-illusion, and
if you can do that, you'll learn more about (in my view) why the
reframe I have offered here is credible. But know that conceptual
knowledge alone (what the book provides) is helpful for many people,
but unlikely to be fully sufficient.

If you really want to dig into the science of all, this I can't say
enough good things about the work of Dr. Robert Sapolsky. He has a
new book coming out: "Determined: The Science of Life Without Free
Will."

I like the work of some of the spiritual teachers like Rupert Spira,
Francis Lucille and John Klein. Again, there's no shortage of good
resources here.

Finally, if this interests you and you'd like to talk more about it,
please reach out. We can have some great discussions and I'd enjoy
talking with you.
