This post is a bit of a diversion and not about software
engineering. You read it at your own risk.

I am in the process of writing a book, with the help of a professional
editor. Two of the main characters in the book are Sam and Marco. The
book will have some software related content, yet it is also about
spiritual matters and other topics that interest me.

Today, I'm posting a draft of a chapter that my editor and I are currently
working on. I'm sharing it
![here](/assets/files/sams-garage.pdf "PDF version of chapter")
because I have just started working with a tool called
[NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com) from
[Google](https://www.google.com).


One of the mind-blowing capabilities of this tool is the ability
to generate an audio overview based on the materials being studied
in the notebook. I invite you to listen to the
[audio](https://common-sense.com/assets/files/sams-garage.mp3)
of the deep dive.
