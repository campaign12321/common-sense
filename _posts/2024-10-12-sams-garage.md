This post is a bit of a diversion, so read at your own risk.

I am in the process of writing a book, with help from a professional
editor. Two of the main characters in the book are Sam and Marco. The
book will have some software content, and maybe a lot, but is also
about spiritual matters and other topics that interest me.

Today, I'm posting a draft of a chapter. I'm sharing it
![here](/assets/files/sams-garage.pdf "PDF version of chapter")
because I have just started working with a tool called
[NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com), from
[Google](https://www.google.com).


One of the mind-blowing capabilities of this tool is the ability
to generate an audio overview based on the materials being studied
in the notebook. I invite you to listen to the
[audio](https://common-sense.com/assets/files/sams-garage.mp3)
of the deep dive.
