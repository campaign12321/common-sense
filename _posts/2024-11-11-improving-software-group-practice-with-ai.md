After a productive team meeting[^1] where Marco's software group used
TOC tools to channel their inspiration from Robert Fisher's visit into
concrete actions, Marco reaches out to Sam to share their
progress. What he discovers is that his old friend has been developing
new ways to enhance these traditional TOC tools using modern AI
capabilities.

Enhancing the Future Reality Tree

That Saturday, Sam was waiting when Marco walked into The Cut Shop, a
small tavern in Woodinville where Sam and Marco met from time to time.
Seeing Sam sitting at a table, Marco walked over and said: "Let me
grab a beer and a sandwich." Sam was already enjoying his usual order:
a shot of Red Breast Irish whiskey, neat, a diet coke, and an order of
fries.

When Marco returned with his order, he pulled out his phone and showed
Sam the photo of their Future Reality Tree. "Remember when you taught
me about these TOC tools? Well, the team really ran with them after
Fisher's visit."

Sam leaned forward, studying the image with interest. "I can see
that. You've got some good connections here. How did the team respond
to the process?"

"Better than I expected," Marco replied, taking a sip of his
beer. "Sarah and Raj especially seemed to grasp the concepts
quickly. Even Tom, who's usually skeptical of anything that feels too
'process-heavy,' got engaged when he saw how it could help us maintain
quality while meeting our deadlines."

Sam nodded, a slight smile playing at the corners of his
mouth. "That's great to hear, Marco. Actually, I've been working on
something that might help you take this even further."

Marco raised an eyebrow. "Oh?"

"Yeah," Sam said, warming to the topic. "You know I have been enamored
with TOC and the TP - Thinking Process - tools that Eli created. I
remember learning about them in the early 90s, and they've stuck with
me ever since.

Back in the day, we didn't really have the internet as you know it
today, so getting documentation on how to use the TP tools wasn't
easy. Somehow, things unfolded so that I learned about a guy teaching
the tools at USC. His name is Bill Dettmer.[^2] He wrote several books
about the tools and also did courses where he taught people how to use
them. I used to see Bill once in a while when he lived in Port
Angeles. Good guy, and I miss him since he moved away recently."

"Everything is impermanent," said Marco quietly.

"Yes, it is," said Sam. I'm grateful to Bill and the many other people
I have met as part of the TOC movement. It's been a blessing to me."

Sam was quiet for a moment, as if collecting this thoughts, and then
continued.

"Well, let's shift gears a bit. I have been I've been exploring ways
to use some of the new AI tools, particularly Claude, to enhance TOC
analysis. I don't know if you know, but I have been using the new AIs
-- LLMs, or Large Language Models -- for about a year now. I am just
blown away by how useful they are to me on a day to day basis. I use
them all the time."

"I have not really had time to look into them," observed Marco. "That
good, huh?"

"Yeah, they are that good. And not expensive. You can get a
subscription to the major models easily. I'm paying about $20 /
month. Actually, that is not quite right, since I'm now using them
more intensively. It's still an incredibly bargain though."

"That's cool, man."

"At any rate, when you mentioned what you and your team had been doing
after the dramatic presentation by Robert Fisher, I did some more work
with them and with the TP tools. To me, it seems like these LLMs and
the TOC TP tools is a marriage made in heaven."

"AI and TOC?" Marco looked intrigued. "How does that work?"

Sam wiped his hands on a napkin and sat back. "Well, long ago Eli had
a comment about the tools. He said that if you use them they will
work, but they require a lot of stamina. Most people just don't seem
to have that much stamina. Maybe it's more that they just aren't wired
to be as curious about cause and effect as I am. I seem to be unable
to resist a good mystery, and when I encounter some unhappy situation,
I kind of can't help trying to unlock the puzzle."

"Well, you've been a software engineer for about 40 years, right? Is
it a surprise that you like solving problems?" Marco grinned.

Sam chuckled. "You know me too well, my friend."

It was true. Sam and Marco had learned a lot about each other, over
the last eight or so years that they had been friends. Each had been
in a difficult spot when they met, and they had supported each other
as they "Worked on their shit," as they would say.

"Marco, you know how building logic trees and writing clouds can
sometimes be challenging? Identifying all the connections, surfacing
hidden assumptions, making sure the logic flows properly?"

Marco nodded emphatically. "Definitely. We spent a good chunk of time
debating some of the connections in our tree."

"What I've figured out," Sam continued, "is how to use Claude to help
with that analysis. It's far from perfect. Yet I have this companion
who doesn't get tired of working on any particular problem, is willing
to dive deep if I want to do it, and is infinitely willing to be as
helpful as possible. It's really a blessing."

Sam paused to take a sip of his whiskey, washing it down with a slurp
of Diet Coke.

"Recently, I've learned how to take it a bit further. I use an
application called Flying Logic. It's an application that is very good
at creating and formatting network-oriented diagrams, like logic trees
and clouds.

The tool doesn't do your thinking for you, but it's really nice for
creating and editing diagrams. It has a layout algorithm in it as well,
that makes your trees and clouds look super."

"That's pretty cool," said Marco. "So I'm guessing you have found some
way to combine your use of AI with the Flying Logic application to
accelerate your use of the TP tools?"

"Exactly," said Sam. "I have been able to use Claude to work up a logic
tree and then have it dump out a JSON file that Flying Logic can import.
It's scratches my perfectionist tendencies just right."

Marco's eyes lit up. "So is all of this to suggest that you and I should
use Claude and Flying Logic to work on the tree and the cloud that my
group and I developed last week?"

"Yep," Sam nodded. "Listen, why don't you come by my place next
Saturday morning? We can hack around a bit in Claude and when we are
happy with our work, we can send it to Flying Logic and see how it
looks."

Marco didn't hesitate. "I'm in. What time?"

"10:00 AM. Bring coffee."

The following Saturday morning found them in Sam's home office, the
autumn sun streaming through the windows as Sam demonstrated his
work. Marco watched, fascinated, as Sam showed him how to use Claude
to analyze their existing Future Reality Tree and identify potential
improvements.

"Watch this," Sam said, typing into the interface. "We'll describe the
tree you created, and see what insights Claude can offer."

Marco leaned forward, reading as Claude analyzed their work. The AI
quickly identified several areas where they could strengthen their
logic, suggested additional connections they hadn't considered, and
helped surface assumptions they hadn't explicitly stated.

"This is incredible," Marco muttered, watching as Claude helped them
explore the implications of their quality-focused initiatives. "It's
like having a TOC expert looking over our shoulder, asking all the
right questions."

"Well, Claude is very capable, but I'd say you still need to have some
subject matter expertise.

For example, at the bottom of a Current Reality Tree -- a CRT -- you
should have some sort of conflict that you can validate as operating
in your environment."

"A conflict?" Marco asked.

"Yeah, think about it. When building a CRT from scratch, we start with
a list of UDEs - Undesirable Effects. Things that happen in our
environment that are problems of one kind or another. Ultimately,
these UDEs are the result of an underlying conflict of some kind. If
your CRT is a good one, it should have this conflict embedded into it,
near its base."

"Oh, I think I get it. Through chains of cause and effect, the conflict
becomes linked to the UDEs, right?"

"Exactly right." said Sam.

"So we start with the UDEs, link them together with our best reasoning,
and ultimately, we should find ourselves connecting them to the conflict
at the base of the CRT?"

"Yep."

"Make sense," said Marco.

"Ok, let's get to work on this," said Sam. For the next hour, Sam,
Marco and Claude worked to develop a CRT that described the current
reality for the firmware team at MedTech. While they worked on it,
Marco noticed that the three of them were truly working together, in a
very collaborative way.

Eventually, Sam sat back and said "I think that's enough for now. Let's
ask Claude to generate a JSON file for us, so we can import our CRT into
Flying Logic and see how it looks."

When the JSON file from Claude had been imported, the screen filled
with a professionally formatted diagram, their team's ideas
transformed into a clear, logical structure that revealed patterns
they might not have seen otherwise.

"See how it highlights the feedback loops?" Sam pointed out.

Marco was already pulling out his notebook. "This could be huge for
us, Sam. The team's committed to making changes after Fisher's visit,
but having tools like this to help us think things through more
systematically..." He shook his head in amazement. "How can I get set
up with this?"

Sam spent the next hour showing Marco how to acquire and set up the
tools - a Flying Logic license, a Claude subscription, and the basic
workflows he'd developed. As they worked, they refined the tree
Marco's team had created, strengthening its logic and identifying
several key initiatives they hadn't considered.

"You know what strikes me?" Marco said as they were wrapping up. "This
is exactly what we needed. Fisher's visit gave us the emotional drive
to improve, but these tools give us the analytical capability to make
those improvements systematic and sustainable."

Sam nodded, pleased. "That's exactly right. Emotion provides the
energy for change, but you need good tools and clear thinking to
channel that energy effectively."

As they headed out for lunch, Marco couldn't help but reflect on how
far they'd come - from their early discussions about free will and
personal growth, to using cutting-edge AI to enhance their
understanding of complex systems. Yet through it all, the fundamental
principles remained the same: focus on what matters, think
systematically, and never lose sight of the human impact of your work.

"Thanks, Sam," he said as they walked to their cars. "Not just for
showing me these tools, but for always helping me see the bigger
picture."

Sam smiled, clapping Marco on the shoulder. "Marco, the work you and
your team is doing touches so many lives in ways you will never know.
I am fortunate to be watch it all unfold."
