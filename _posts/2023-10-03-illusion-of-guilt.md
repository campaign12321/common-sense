## The Illusion of Guilt in Software Development Decisions

I couldn't help but cringe when I saw my colleague's message in our
project chat: "I don't have the heart to tell Joe that we haven't used
[Software Tool] since we licensed it a year ago. Now we need to renew
the license."

This scenario is all too common in the software development world. We
make decisions that seem sound at the moment, only to later question
their wisdom. This often leads to a sense of guilt, but I argue that
such guilt is both misplaced and unearned, stemming from a few
fundamental misconceptions.

### The Unpredictability of the Future

Firstly, there's the assumption that the future is predictable. It's
not. While we can make educated guesses about future events, certainty
remains elusive. The further into the future we try to project, the
greater the likelihood that our predictions will miss the mark.

For a thought-provoking perspective on this, I recommend watching Alan
Watts' two-minute
["Chinese Farmer"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWd6fNVZ20o)
story on YouTube. If it doesn't dramatically shift your viewpoint, I'd be
interested to hear why.

### The Fallacy of Single Causes

Another reason we often shoulder unearned guilt is the belief that
events have single, identifiable causes. This is rarely, if ever, the
case.

Consider the cautionary tale "For Want of a Nail":

```
  For want of a nail the shoe was lost,
  For want of a shoe the horse was lost,
  For want of a horse the rider was lost,
  For want of a rider the battle was lost,
  For want of a battle the kingdom was lost,
  And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.
```

This tale eloquently illustrates that outcomes are usually the result
of a chain of events, many of which are beyond our control. If you
find yourself feeling guilty about the "loss of a kingdom," perhaps
it's time to have a word with the king's farrier. He's the one who
failed to ensure all the horseshoes were properly fitted before the
battle commenced.

Of course, the farrier could argue that he, too, was a victim of a
series of preceding events beyond his control. And he'd be correct.

### The Right Kind of Guilt

In conclusion, I'm not advocating for a complete absence of
guilt. Guilt has its place; it's a human emotion that serves a
purpose. However, that purpose is seldom what our minds conjure up
when we try to rationalize our feelings of guilt.

Software projects are more likely to succeed when team members are not
burdened by guilt for things beyond their grasp. And let's face
itâ€”most things are beyond our control.
