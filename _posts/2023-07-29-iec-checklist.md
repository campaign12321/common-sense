Some time back we developed a simple checklist for [IEC 62304 – 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_62304).

Based on the number of requests over the years, it’s clear that many people found it useful.

We are now in the process of updating and enhancing the checklist, as well as developing a set of customizable procedures to go with it.

If you’d like a copy of the original checklist and to receive periodic updates when we produce them please subscribe for updates.
