Code reviews should be a central part of your software engineering
group practice. If they are not your group will underperform relative
to a software engineering group that does have an effective code
review practice.

Code reviews are widely considered one of the most effective means for
finding defects in software. They serve as a crucial quality assurance
step in the software development process. There are several reasons for
this:

1. **Human Insight**: Code reviews leverage the collective
   intelligence of the development team. Different individuals bring
   diverse perspectives to the codebase. This diversity in thinking
   can uncover defects that automated testing tools may overlook. A
   study published in "Empirical Software Engineering" by V. Basili et
   al. in 2012 supports this by highlighting that code inspections (a
   form of code review) can discover up to 85% of software defects.

2. **Knowledge Transfer**: Code reviews facilitate knowledge sharing
   and mentorship. By actively engaging in code reviews, team members,
   especially less experienced ones, learn from more experienced team
   members. This not only helps in defect identification but also in
   promoting a culture of continuous learning and improvement.

3. **Contextual Understanding**: Code reviewers often possess a deep
   understanding of the application's context and business logic.
   This contextual awareness is invaluable for identifying defects
   related to functionality, security, and compliance. Research by
   D. E. Perry and A. L. Wolf in their paper "Foundations for the
   Study of Software Architecture" (1992) emphasizes the significance
   of understanding the architecture and design context when
   identifying defects.

4. **Cost Efficiency**: Early defect detection through code reviews
   can significantly reduce the cost of fixing issues in later stages
   of development or after deployment. A report by IBM Systems
   Sciences Institute titled "Costs of Correcting Software Errors"
   demonstrates that identifying and rectifying defects during coding
   is far more cost-effective than addressing them in post-production
   phases.

Code reviews harness human insight, promote knowledge sharing, offer
contextual understanding, and enhance cost efficiency. They are an
essential practice for maintaining software quality and align with a
dedication to excellence.
