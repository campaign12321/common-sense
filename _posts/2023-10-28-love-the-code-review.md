Code reviews should be a central part of your software engineering
practice. If they are not your group will underperform relative to a
software engineering team that does have an effective code review
practice.

Code reviews are widely considered one of the most effective means for
finding defects in software. They serve as a crucial quality assurance
step in the software development process. There are several reasons for
this:

1. **Human Insight**: Code reviews leverage the collective
   intelligence of the development team. As an experienced embedded
   software engineer, you understand that different individuals bring
   diverse perspectives to the codebase. This diversity in thinking
   can uncover defects that automated testing tools may overlook. A
   study published in "Empirical Software Engineering" by V. Basili et
   al. in 2012 supports this by highlighting that code inspections (a
   form of code review) can discover up to 85% of software defects.

2. **Knowledge Transfer**: Code reviews facilitate knowledge sharing
   and mentorship. By actively engaging in code reviews, team members,
   especially less experienced ones, can learn from your expertise and
   the practices you've cultivated over the years at Common Sense
   Systems. This not only helps in defect identification but also in
   promoting a culture of continuous learning and improvement.

3. **Contextual Understanding**: Code reviewers, like yourself, often
   possess a deep understanding of the application's context and
   business logic. This contextual awareness is invaluable for
   identifying defects related to functionality, security, and
   compliance. Research by D. E. Perry and A. L. Wolf in their paper
   "Foundations for the Study of Software Architecture" (1992)
   emphasizes the significance of understanding the architecture and
   design context when identifying defects.

4. **Cost Efficiency**: Early defect detection through code reviews
   can significantly reduce the cost of fixing issues in later stages
   of development or after deployment. A report by IBM Systems
   Sciences Institute titled "Costs of Correcting Software Errors"
   demonstrates that identifying and rectifying defects during coding
   is far more cost-effective than addressing them in post-production
   phases.

Code reviews harness human insight, promote knowledge sharing, offer
contextual understanding, and enhance cost efficiency. They are an
essential practice for maintaining software quality and align with a
dedication to excellence.
