## WHAT DO YOU DO?

I work with people who have a genuine interest in improving their ability to practice the art and science of software engineering.

I am able to help both individuals and small companies. It’s probably best to view me as a highly technical coach that wants to help his clients succeed. Yet I have other skills and abilities that I also offer to clients, as further described below.

By highly technical I mean to communicate that my career has been embedded software engineering in high-tech companies for almost 40 years. That includes a lot of hands-on software engineering work, as well as managing teams and managing other managers.

More information on Common Sense is also [available]({{ '/about-us' | relative_url }}).

## MY ROLE AS A COACH

When I’m working more as a coach I see my role as providing the client with a perspective they would not otherwise have. To my knowledge most coaches take this approach. My interest is in connecting with my clients to understand and discuss with them what they want to accomplish, and then I work with them to develop observations and suggestions that they can try on for size or ignore as they see it.

## MY ROLE AS AN INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTOR

I also contribute to my client’s success by solving specific problems they want my help with. Those problems may be highly technical and software-oriented, or they may be more around problem solving and communications within the team.

Process improvement is a deep and lasting interest of mine. I am also certified by [TOCICO](http://tocico.org/).

## MY ROLE AS AN EDUCATOR

I value thinking, writing and sharing my thoughts. So I see one of my roles in life as developing helpful ways to frame, understand and share my thinking with others. If you want to see examples of my work, please have a look at [the blog that I publish]({{ '/blog' | relative_url }}) on this website.
