We design, implement and sell turn-key embedded software development
environments.

Customers can license one of our development environment kits and have 
them up and running in a matter of a few hours or less.

The development environments are pre-configured to enable the creation
of embedded software of the highest quality.

Our development environments allow customers to skip the work normally
required to create the infrastructure typically required to develop
high-quality embedded software.

# Potential Customers

Our customers are qualified individuals that want to avoid tedious,
non-value added work and proceed more quickly to the nuts and bolts of
creating their embedded software.

A qualified individual is someone who has significant influence over
an embedded software project. This would typically be someone like a
VP of Engineering or similar.

A suitable project is:

1. One that is developing complex embedded software in C or C++,

2. Is one that is likely to take several engineers a year or more to
   complete,

3. Will not be using or inheriting an existing development environment
   or a fixed set of development processes,
   
4. Is being managed by people with a compelling interest in the
   success of the project.
   
# Our Offer

We design, implement and deliver turn-key embedded software
development environments for our customers.

We integrate best-of-breed software development tools into a single
working development environment. Setup typically takes less than an
hour once the infrastructure is in place. 

If a customer wants the environment tailored in any way, we offer
customization services.

We also offer support and maintenance contracts to customers.

Maintenance contracts help our customers keep their development
environments current as software tools and practices change over time.

Support contracts provide our customers with technical support and 
assistance in resolving problems that arise during use.


Customers use these environments to greatly increase their chances 
of creating valuable embedded software quickly and reliably.

# Our Environments

An embedded software design environment from Common Sense has multiple
components. It is a system for developing complex software. The system
is effective and reliable.

Software design environments (factories, really) have the following as 
major system elements:

1. Policies (rules of the road) for managing the factory,

2. Work instructions for operations within the factory, 

3. Tools for use within the factory,
