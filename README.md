# Common Sense Systems

Comments for John:
- I added buttons at the end of blog posts to share to social media - let me know if you want to remove it
- Let me know if you want to remove the date from being shown on blog posts
- The current page doesn't get highlighted in the navigation bar menu
- You can edit/add any page directly from GitHub. Or you can also do it from any unix machine if you have jekyll set up, to run the website locally use `bundle install && bundle exec jekyll serve -H <IP_ADDRESS>`
- You should go through the `_config.yml` file and edit any parameters you want to
